## 📁 What You’ll Find Here

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `led_sequence.py` | Turn multiple LEDs on and off in sequence using GPIO pins |
| `led_pair_blink.py` | Control LED pairs turning on and off together |
| `pwm_led_fade.py` | Smooth brightness control using PWM |
| `multi_pwm_control.py` | PWM fading on multiple LEDs |
| *(more coming...)* | Projects will be added regularly |

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to control GPIO pins on ESP32
- Using **PWM** to control LED brightness
- Writing efficient **loops and delays**
- Creating effects like sequencing and fading
- Basics of **MicroPython** syntax and structure

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Required

- ESP32 Development Board
- Breadboard + Jumper Wires
- LEDs (1–5)
- Resistors (220Ω – 330Ω)
- (Optional: Sensors, buzzers, displays for future projects)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Flash MicroPython firmware on your ESP32:  
   [Official Guide](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html)

2. Use a serial tool like **Thonny**, **uPyCraft**, or **MPFShell**

3. Upload the `.py` files to your ESP32

4. Run and enjoy blinking lights or fading effects ✨

## 📌 Notes

- All code is written for **MicroPython on ESP32**
- Feel free to modify GPIO pins or timing to suit your setup
- Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
